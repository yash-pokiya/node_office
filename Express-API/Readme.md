## Express API Flow

Request → Route → (Middleware) → Controller → Service → Database
↓
Response ←──────────────────── Controller ←─

## Bakend Data Flow

1. Request arrives at Express
   ↓
2. app.js runs Helmet (security headers)
   ↓
3. app.js runs CORS check (is this origin allowed?)
   ↓
4. app.js runs Rate Limiter (has this IP sent too many requests?)
   ↓
5. Route matched: POST /api/v1/products → product.route.js
   ↓
6. validate(createProductSchema) middleware runs:
   ✅ "name" is a string ✓
   ✅ "price" is a number ✓
   → req.body is now safe, typed data
   ↓
7. productController.createProduct() runs
   ↓
8. ProductService.createProduct(req.body) is called
   ↓
9. MongoDB saves the document
   ↓
10. Controller sends: 201 { success: true, data: { ... }, message: "Product created" }
